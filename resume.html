                      <h2>LAMP Designer/Developer</h2>
                      <p>
                        An  innovative technology champion consistently developing solutions in educational and 
                              business settings.  An avid hands-on teacher/learner comfortable in networking and 
                              software environments, with experiences in building responsive and interactive websites 
                              and applications. I adapt easily to challenging situations. I enjoy learning new 
                              technologies and devising strategies to solve problems. I have found that paying close 
                              attention to detail produces high-quality work the first time, and that keeps me from 
                              having to do it again. I try to understand your needs, goals, and frustrations  to engineer 
                              a path forward. I have the communication skills to explain complex situations or processes 
                              and make them simple to understand. I help companies accomplish their goals faster and 
                              cheaper than they ever thought possible.  I make sure technology works for you instead of 
                              against you.
